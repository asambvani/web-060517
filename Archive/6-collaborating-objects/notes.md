1. Describe what is happening in environment.
  what is each line doing?
  Why do we need to do this?

  Require loads file from specific file path, if no path given, pulls from ruby gem folder.
  Require_relative pulls from relative file name.

2. What is happening in console.rb
  - what do you have access to if you run ruby console.rb

  Loading environment.rb using require_relative. Reloading using 'load

3. Note that we have an artist class and a song class.  Describe the relationship between artists and songs.
  artist -> songs
  artist.songs
  song.artist


4. Build out the following
  - Artist.all
    -> should return all of the artists that have been initialized
  - Song.all
    -> should return all of the songs that have been initialized
  - Artist.reset
    -> should clear all of the artists from the class variable @@all in artist.  (After calling Artist.reset, Artist.all should return [])
  - Build the following getter and setter methods
    For artist: name
    For song: name
  - Build the following instance method
    - artist.add_song(song)
      You should pass through a *song instance* to the add_song method
      After passing through a song to the add_song() method, you should be able to call artist.songs -> [song]
      (ie it should return an array with the song you added, in the array)
    - Bonus
      - kanye = Artist.new
      - touch_the_sky = Song.new
      - After calling  kanye.add_song(touch_the_sky)
      then, without doing anything else, if I call...
     touch_the_sky.artist -> kanye
     (it should return kanye)
