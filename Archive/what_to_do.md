Why am I telling them this.

I. What do the teachers do
 - taking questions, taking the discussion in the direction of the class, but being very clear about how to think about something in practice
 - still clarifying the proper approach
- use clear and precise language
- analogies, can be related to real world scenarios
- allow us to explain it to each other, if you can teach someone something
- address students fears, because that impedes on progress

- pigeon lab -
  divided them for steps
  

II. What do the students do
  - not being afraid to ask questions, when things are not clear
  - listen carefully, be sure to stay on point
