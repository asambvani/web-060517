1. Modeling Notes
○ A musical note has three characteristics: pitch, rhythm and decibels.  Pitch is the musical tone of the note (a, b, c).  The rhythm is the length of the note.  And decibels is how loud the note is.  Represent the characteristics of a sequence of three notes using only arrays.
○ Now represent the problem, using arrays, hashes, or a combination of both.
2. Modeling countries
  § Now model the following.  We want a list of countries, and  for each country have the associated colors of the flag, and its capital city.  Do this for the United States, Spain, and Russia.  Place these in alphabetical order.
3. So in what circumstances should we use an array, and when should we use a hash?
