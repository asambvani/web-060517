Learning Goals
  - Readability is king
    - Sandwich Code
  - Preprocessing
I. Questions to review
    1. (4) Return a collection of all elements who begin with a letter t in an array
        - which methods can we use, what are the costs and benefits of them
        - Each
        - What if we really want to use each?  So why not?
        1. Focuses on the details instead of our intent
  			2. Pollutes the global scope
  			ยง Benefits -> can understand exactly what is occurring, smaller api
    2. (5) Capitalize the first word of each element in the array
    3. (12) For each string in the array, we want to go through each of the words,
    4.      and return an array with each word of each element capitalized

II. Make outline of the array methods
  - If I want to change each element in the array
  - If I want to reduce the number of elements in the array
